          <span> This is an interactive art project for my art school graduation. </span>

          <strong> I wanted to Demonstrate possibilities of Web Technologies on Art projects.</strong>
          <br/> <br/> I tried to use web technologies as much as I can. They have a great spectrum of ability. I wish more people would try to build art projects with these ultimate possibilities.
